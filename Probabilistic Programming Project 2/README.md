# Bayesian Neural Networks

The task: 
- Start with a network architecture Training: using the training data (observed) infer the posterior distribution of "w"
- Testing: using this posterior distribution predict the labels of testing data
- Compare to “classic” neural networks results on the same problem
- Do this for both binary classification and multiclass classification
